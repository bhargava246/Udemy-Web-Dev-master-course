server is just a software which server u at any point of time
server listens at some ports

so basicly frontend request some data from the database and with the help of apis we serve those request
so we can basicly write whole server in js but it was made to be run on a browser so it has no meathods of interacting with the files and hence node came into picture
node gives many power to js

  
nginx a server used to serve requests on the server the frontend would make a request on a port opened by nginx it would listen on the port and find those files and serve on that port 
in the server try concatinating ext if ext is not mentioned in the req
